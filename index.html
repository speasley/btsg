      <h3>BTSG YYC</h3>
      <p>The goal of the YYC Brain Tumour Support Group is to be a place to share resources that might be helpful to those attending support groups but just can&rsquo;t remember what book or website that someone has mentioned. It happens to us pretty much everywhere we go&hellip;</p>
      <p>Feel free to send us links, books, or other resources that you think might be helpful and we can try to get them up on the site. If you are looking for a resource that was mentioned at a meeting, send a request. We will publish it and hopefully someone remembers what it was.</p>
